# Predicting the future health and investability of public companies using published financial data.
_Using standard released financial data along with machine learning classification models to predict an overall health/investment rating for a business_

## Business Problem 
There needs to be more comprehensive and reliable tools for individual investors to assess a company's financial stability and potential for sustainable growth. 
When relying on traditional financial metrics and analysis, many investors need help identifying healthy companies to invest in.  
This is because these metrics only partially capture the entire picture of a company's long-term viability.

## The Solution

*Objective:* Our Focus is to assist individual investors by building a predictive machine learning model (**Business Health Predictor**) to rate individual companies with a business health grade as a suggestive indicator for investment worthiness. 

*Method:*

*Success Criteria:* 


## Data Understanding and Preparation
The data sourced for this project is from a Kaggle.com repository for American companies

## Modeling and Evaluation

## Conclusion 
   
#### Future Work

1. Refresh the dataset to obtain financial information for the current period from 2019-2022
2. Review for changes in predictive modeling around impactful business events (pre and post-Covid, recessionary periods, etc.)
3. Obtain industry data for companies to review how the models are affected when used for specific industry categories.
4. Include outstanding stock and price of stock at YE to reviw any affects on the model as build.
