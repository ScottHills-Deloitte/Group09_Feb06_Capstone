## Modeling and Evaluation

## Conclusion 
   
#### Future Work

1. Refresh the dataset to obtain financial information for the current period from 2019-2022
2. Review for changes in predictive modeling around impactful business events (pre and post-Covid, recessionary periods, etc.)
3. Obtain industry data for companies to review how the models are affected when used for specific industry categories.
4. Include outstanding stock and price of stock at YE to reviw any affects on the model as build.
